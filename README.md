# dijkstra
Different implementations of a Graph data type, and Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths

Default implementation uses an adjacency matrix, where edges[source][destination] returns the edge weight between source and destination. A zero value represents no adjacency.

The second implementation is in progress, and uses an adjacency list: vertices are stored as objects, each holding a list of vertices which are adjacent to them, and their respective distances.

The input that runs by default matches the provided image.
